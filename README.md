# Preface
After every class, I am making documentation what you have learned from class, plus some appropriate resource link to accelerate your learning. Which took me about 1.5 hours after every class. My objectives is make you good @ web development, make you fluent @ web technology, make you fluent @ technology. Therefore this amount of hour expending after every class its not adding value to my carrier, Or Lict people didn't asked me for that. Therefore I am doing it, so that you  can use it as your life time reference. You know its totally impossible to explain everything in this class gist documentation. But I am focusing on core things. But you have to learn beyond this gist from different source, official website. Do hard work for next 3 months, it definitely will help  you, in your whole life.
